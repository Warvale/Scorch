Scorch
======

## Create and grow your Guild to raid enemy islands across a magma-split world. 

### **Scorch** is organized by Guilds, Regions (Islands), Loot and the Game Physics. 

**Guilds**:
Guilds are Scorch's version of Factions: grow your guild and come to power by invading the enemy. Use special guild commands like invitation, guild roles, guild management commands, and guild comments to protect your power. Guilds can unite to expand their power and control to dominate the world.

**Regions (Islands)**:
The world you may see in a vanilla Minecraft server is vastly different from the Scorch world. In Scorch, all islands (which are usually 90x90 in size) are separated by a massive lava ocean, preventing regular travel. Instead, players must utilize special items like the water bucket to go raiding. Be careful though, as your obsidian bridge made by your water will not last long!

**Loot**:
There are two kinds of loot in Scorch: chest loot, and crate loot. Chest loot can appear in randomly-spawning chests throughout the world. They can contain very powerful items, and the loot inside is dependant upon the biome of the island you are on. The other type of loot is crate loot. Crate loot can only be obtained by opening a crate. Crates have four types of rarity: Common, Rare, Legendary, and Mythical. Each tier of rarity is progressively harder to get an item for!

**Game Physics**: 
There are a few basic physics and rules of Scorch in order to make it work. Firstly, all islands and guilds in Scorch are protected by their Bed, which is in the middle of their island. If that bed is broken, a new Guild will steal access to your island. Protect your bed with custom weapons like automated turrets, NPCs to be on the lookout, and your guild members. Losing your island's bed will drop your power and you will have to find a new home!

Scorch is not a game that will start and end. Instead, it is constantly running for anyone to come and raid your base, requiring you to always be on the lookout. The Scorch world may reset every few given months. Good luck growing your guild!
