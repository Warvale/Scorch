[How power, beds, territories, and island regions work in the game: Explained]

* If you are not in a guild, you CANNOT claim an island
* If you are not in a guild, you CANNOT break a bed
* If you are not in a guild, you CANNOT get power or territory

Once you make or join a guild, you are now able to: 
- Claim unclaimed islands
- Take over another guild's base
- Gain power and territory
- Create alliances with other guilds

How claiming unclaimed land works:
- Find an island with a bed on it that is not claimed. 
   + You will know if it is claimed once you walk into the island region and it says "Entering unknown territory"
- Attempt to sleep in the bed.
   + If it is day, you will still be able to claim it regularly
- Once you interact with the bed, that island is now yours.
   + You can protect it, build on it, break it, and safeguard the bed from potential attackers.
   
How claiming another guild's land works:
- Find an island that is owned by a guild.
   + You will know if it is a guild's if there's structures on it, or you walk in the region and it says "Claimed by x"
- Locate the bed of the island, and sleep in it.
   + You will then gain access to the island. Members of the guild who previously owned it can no longer break or place.
   + There will be a 1-hour shield over your newly claimed island. Once you take over an island, people cannot take it back for 1 hour.
   + However, you will not have a shield for claiming an unclaimed island. There is no shield for that. 
   + The shield prevents you from losing the island access. You can still kill or be killed. 
- Protect the bed and kick out the previous members entirely. 

How owning an island affects your power:
- When you own an island, you have 100% access to edit it and protect it. Your bed maintains the protection. 
- When you die, you will respawn on the island with the bed. If you have multiple-owned islands, the guild leader can
choose which island is the "hub" or respawn island. You will NOT be able to fast-travel or directly teleport to islands that
are not your hub. You can, however, teleport to a guild member who happens to be there. 
- The more power or islands you own, the easier it is to gain resources to mass-protect them. 

* The goal of owning or being in a Guild is to have absolute domination, or a monopoly. Once one single guild grows huge to power, if 
any smaller guilds can unite to take it down, then the power is split between a lot of people and the process reboots. The point of the
game is to grow big and maintain your power before being removed from it.
